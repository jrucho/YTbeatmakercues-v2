# YouTube Beatmaker Cues - Chrome Extension

You can try out my new website with some of the extension‚Äôs features here, before downloading it: https://bit.ly/beatmakercues

> This extension was inspired by the muscle memory workflow of the OP-Z, the versatility of Ableton Live, and the hands-on approach I developed over the years using the SP-404.

Mark cue points, loop audio/video, apply live effects, and customize your beatmaking experience on YouTube.

The **YouTube Beatmaker Cues** extension supports precise pitch adjustments, audio and video looping, effects toggling, and intuitive cue management. Use keyboard shortcuts or the detailed Advanced Panel for quick control.

## New in 1.6.4
* Super Knob: absolute & endless encoder support. The master ‚ÄúSuper Knob‚Äù now auto-detects standard absolute MIDI knobs and endless/relative encoders, with configurable sensitivity and wrap-safe smoothing.
* MIDI Loopers = Session-View style. MIDI loopers now behave like Ableton‚Äôs Session View: launching one clip/slot on a track stops the previously playing clip on that track (exclusive switching), quantized to the global grid. This lets you structure beats on the fly. (Audio loopers remain classic synced loopers.)
* Modifier-mute for pads & keys. Hold Shift or Cmd (Ctrl on Windows/Linux) and press a sample pad or mapped keyboard key to mute/unmute that looper instantly.

## New in 1.6.3
* Allowed the looper import picker to accept both audio and video containers so MP4 audio tracks can be selected.
* Reused the standard loop finalisation pipeline for imported media to populate the active looper slot and start playback reliably.
  
## New in 1.6.2
* Added state tracking and a handleShiftTap routine so Shift (midi button) taps can play the video on pause or pause it on double-tap

## New in 1.6.1
* Added shift+pad to use as a mute toggle for drum samples
  
## New in 1.6
* Unified TransportClock syncs audio and MIDI loops
* Four MIDI loopers mirror the audio loopers with matching colors and progress bars
* Switch between audio and MIDI loopers in the Advanced panel
* Undo and redo restore MIDI loops

## New in 1.5
* "Nova Bass" synth window with realtime controls and pitch sync to the video feed
* Layer multiple presets or generate new ones with the **Random** button
* Synth stays off until opened and fades out cleanly when closed
* Loops align perfectly to the master start time for rock‚Äësolid sync
* Progress bars track each loop's own start so visuals line up every time
* The longest clip becomes the reference so loops of different lengths stay in phase
* Newly recorded loops begin playing on the very next bar for snappier response
* Reduced latency and cleaner loop boundaries for punchier recordings

## Update 1.4
* Four independent audio loopers with bright progress bars beneath the looper button
* Each bar shows four tick marks so you can follow the beat
* Progress bars are a uniform 1.4‚Äâpx thick
* Export downloads every active loop as its own track with BPM
* Pitching loops renames files with `-pitched-<BPM>bpm`


## Update 1.3
* Works inside the YouTube iframe on [Samplette.io](https://samplette.io) and other `youtube-nocookie.com` embeds, even when the referrer is hidden. The toolbar becomes scrollable and MIDI features are disabled there.
* Minimal bar and advanced window become scrollable when space is limited
* Route audio to any available output device via the **Audio Out** dropdown ("Default output" preselected)
* Choose your microphone via the **Audio In** dropdown ("Default input" preselected)
* Choose a device from the **Monitor In** dropdown and toggle **Mon On/Off** to hear that source through your computer's default speakers. Monitoring starts off on each page load and stops cleanly when you navigate away.
* Output routing adjusts automatically when selecting a new device
* Lower latency when switching outputs using native sink routing when supported
* Input monitoring uses a separate low-latency `AudioContext` for minimal delay
* Advanced control buttons now display in two columns for easier access
* **Super Knob** scrolls cues using any MIDI CC. Endless encoders behave like
  regular 0‚Äì127 knobs for now. Hold **Shift** to reposition before continuing
  and choose a speed (1‚Äì3) in the MIDI mapping window. Speed **1** is the
  default, with **2** and **3** moving cues faster.
* Avoids duplicate initialization in YouTube iframes to prevent freezes
* Mic button cycles Off ‚Üí Record (green) ‚Üí Monitor (red) so you can hear the mic while capturing loops
* Adjust cue points live using a single MIDI knob

(Thanks for the video Noche !)

The extension supports managing multiple sample packs at once. Use the multi-
select dropdown in the advanced panel to load several packs together or delete
unused ones. Creating a new pack only asks for a name; you can later import
kicks, hihats and snares using each row‚Äôs "Imp" button. Samples are stored in
the pack and persist between sessions. You can delete individual samples from
any pack; built-in samples remain protected, but extra ones you add to the
built-in pack can be removed.

Manage multiple compressors (Native, Tape Warm, Roland SP404OG) to shape your audio character. Adjust settings effortlessly through a user-friendly interface.

Integrate MIDI controllers with customizable mappings to trigger cues, samples, and effects directly.

Samples and cue points persist between sessions. Easily export loops, manage cues, and maintain workflow efficiency.

## Key Features

- üéØ **Cue Points**  
  Set up to 10 visual cue points on any YouTube video. Use keyboard shortcuts or drag & drop markers.

- üîÅ **Audio & Video Loopers**
  Record loops in sync with video or audio. Use `R`, `S`, `D`, or `F` to control
  up to four separate audio loops. The first loop defines the bar length and tempo.
  Additional loops of any bar count launch on the next bar so everything stays aligned.
  Loops keep the exact length you recorded with no trimming. Press the loop key again
  to finish recording on the next bar. Double press a loop key to mute that loop at
  the bar boundary and single press to unmute instantly‚Äîjust like legato mode. Double
  press twice more to erase it. Loops rejoin mid‚Äëphrase so sync stays tight even when
  loops have different lengths. Exporting downloads each active loop with the rounded
  BPM in the file name. Use `V` for the video looper and double press to erase it.
  Hold Option¬†+¬†**Cmd+R** to erase all loops. Each looper button shows a slim progress
  bar that pulses while recording. Hold the mapped **MIDI Shift** note while pressing
  any loop key to erase that loop instantly. Progress bars speed up or slow down when
  loops are pitched so the visuals stay in sync.

- üéöÔ∏è **Pitch Control**  
  Independent pitch control for video and loop playback. When targeting loops,
  the pitch slider adjusts all four audio loopers together and exported files
  include the modified pitch. If loops are pitched when exporting, each file
  name ends with `-pitched-<BPM>bpm` where `<BPM>` reflects the new tempo.
  Export uses offline rendering for reliability.

- üéõÔ∏è **Live Effects**  
  Toggle EQ (`E`), Compressor (`C`), Reverb (`Q`), and Cassette (`W`) in real time.

- üëÅÔ∏è **Minimal & Advanced UI**  
  Choose between a clean minimal bar or a full panel with all controls.

- ü•Å **Sample Kits**  
  Manage built-in and imported samples (kick, hihat, snare), randomize or load packs on demand.

- üéπ **MIDI Support**
  Use your MIDI controller to trigger actions. Custom mappings are available via UI, including key and MIDI assignments for all four loopers.

- ‚èØÔ∏è **Shift Play/Pause**
  Quick-tap the Shift key (or mapped MIDI Shift note) to play when paused.
  Double-tap Shift while playing to pause the video, and holding Shift still acts as a modifier for other controls.

- üîÑ **Super Knob**
  Select any cue via pad, keyboard, or MIDI note and twist the mapped knob to
  slide its position left or right. Endless encoders currently act like normal
  0‚Äì127 knobs for maximum stability. Hold Shift (or a MIDI shift note) to
  reposition, and choose a speed from 1 (default) to 3 in the MIDI mapping
  window. Any CC number can be assigned.

- üëá **Touch Sequencer**  
  10 pads, 16-step sequencer, tap tempo, and BPM-based triggering.

| Show Advanced Panel | A |

Press **N** or the advanced panel‚Äôs **Instrument** button to show the Nova Bass window. Opening the window activates your last preset if the synth was off; closing it powers the synth down. The minimal bar has its own Instrument button that simply toggles the synth on or off without opening the window. Twelve built-in presets‚ÄîResonate, Precision, 808 Boom, Warm Organ, Moog Thump, Soft Pad, String Ensemble, FM Keys, Pluck, Sweep Lead, Bass Cut and Sample Tone‚Äîcover a wide range of classic tones and play at **15% volume** by default. You can layer multiple presets together just like sample packs. Compression and limiter sliders make it easy to tame levels.
The popup hides detailed controls until you click **Advanced**, keeping the interface clean.
While the synth is active, the `1‚Äì0` keys plus `-` and `=` play a chromatic scale from the chosen octave. The **Scale** dropdown lets you switch to major or minor if desired.
The synth has a pitch fader synced to the video by default. Uncheck **Sync Video** to adjust it independently and use the transpose slider for coarse tuning. A dedicated **Tune** slider lets you shift each preset in 12‚Äëstep increments from ‚àí24 to +24¬†semitones, and the value is stored per preset. All parameters are adjusted with labeled sliders so you know exactly what each one does.

Moving any knob instantly updates the current preset. Built‚Äëin presets cannot be deleted but you can save your tweaks as new ones. Each preset stores oscillator type, engine (analog, FM, wavetable or sampler), filter, ADSR, effects and **Mode** (poly, mono or legato). Example wavetables and a sample tone demonstrate these engines.
In mono mode, triggering a new note now cuts the previous one immediately so bass lines stay tight.

Each preset stores oscillator type, engine, filter settings, ADSR envelope and effect parameters (delay, reverb, compression, limiter, volume and LFO). Use **Save** to keep changes, **Delete** to remove custom presets or **Export** to share them. The **Random** button quickly generates a usable sound.

All loop keys and MIDI notes can be reassigned in the Key Mapping and MIDI Mapping windows.
Holding the MIDI Shift note while pressing a loop note erases that loop.

## Touch Sequencer

- Press `T` to open
- Press `S` to start/stop
- Set cue points on pads or trigger them
- Use the 16-step grid to play cues rhythmically
- Tap tempo, erase steps, or close the window anytime

## Compressors

- **Native:** Hard, clear compression.
- **Ultra Tape:** Vintage saturation, SP303-inspired.
- **Bright Open:** Bright and clean compression with analog warmth.

> üîä *Tip: Reduce YouTube volume to ~40‚Äì50% for best effect with compression modes.*
