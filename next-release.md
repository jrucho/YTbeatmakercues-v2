# Next Release Notes (2.0.3)

## Highlights
- Sidechain taps—whether from the **J** key, MIDI, or kick/all-drum follow—are now written into MIDI looper clips so your recorded grooves keep the same pump when they loop.
- MIDI loop playback replays the captured sidechain envelope automatically, matching the curve you selected for kicks or the full kit.

This release focuses on making sidechain ducking fully recordable and repeatable inside MIDI loopers without changing your existing workflow.
