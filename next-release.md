# Next Release Notes (2.0.2)

## Highlights
- Added a sidechain launch button to the Advanced window so you can pop open the ducking controls (with advanced mode enabled) without hunting for shortcuts.
- Simplified the sidechain popup header to a clean title and close button while keeping everything inside the canvas area.
- Ensured kick/all-drum sidechaining always uses the currently selected curve—whether triggered from keys or MIDI—so drum-follow ducking matches what you dialed in.

These changes focus on a cleaner sidechain workflow while maintaining the streamlined YouTube-inspired look.
